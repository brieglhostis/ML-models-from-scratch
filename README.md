# ML models from scratch

This project is a personal challenge to dive deeper into the inner-workings of the most popular Machine Learning models. The goal is to implement common Machine Learning models with nothing more than vanilla Python and the numpy library.

# Implementation list

Finalised models
- **Linear regression** (including Ridge and Lasso regressions)
- **Logistic regression** (binary classification only)
- **Decision trees** (regression and classification)
- **Random forest** (regression and classification)
- **Gradient boosting** (regression only)
- **SVM**: (regression and classification)
- **Regular regression neural network** (dense layers only)
- **Recurrent neural network** (RNN & LSTM, regression only)

Work in progress
- **Recurrent neural network** (RNN & LSTM): classification, regression done
- **Gradient boosting**: classification, regression done
- **Transformer**: WIP

Next models
- **AdaBoost**
- **Convolutional neural network**
