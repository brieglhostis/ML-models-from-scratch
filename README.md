# ML models from scratch

This project is a personal challenge to dive deeper into the inner-workings of the most popular Machine Learning models. The goal is to implement common Machine Learning models with nothing more than vanilla Python and the numpy library.

# Implementation list

Finalised models
- **Linear regression** (including Ridge and Lasso regressions)

Work in progress
- **Regular regression neural network** (Dense layers only): batch normalization gradients to correct
- **Recurrent neural network** (RNN & LSTM): batch normalization gradients to correct
- **Transformer**: WIP

Next models
- **Logistic regression**
- **Decision trees**
- **Random forest**
- **SVM** 
- **Boosting methods**
- **Convolutional neural network**
